In this assignment, you'll have the opportunity to apply your knowledge of handling exceptions in a practical setting. We'll tackle real-world scenarios, honing your skills in writing robust and error-resistant code.\n\nHow to navigate the lab:\n\n- For some exercises, you will need to fill in the blanks by adding the correct sentences or code. Look for ## YOUR CODE HERE.\n- In certain sections, you are required to explain why the code behaves in specific ways. Identify these with a ‚ùìüí¨‚ùì mark.\n- In some parts, you will need to write a piece of code entirely on your own.

The commonest thing is delightful if \\\none only hides it. When I leave town now I never tell my people where I \\\nam going. If I did, I would lose all my pleasure.
