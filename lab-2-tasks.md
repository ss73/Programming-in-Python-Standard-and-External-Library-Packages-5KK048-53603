(i) The datetime module documentation can be found at [https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html]

(ii) _Explicit Type Conversion_ is used when Python can not deduce the type automatically, e.g. if you want to get the integer value out of a string, ``int('12345')``

(iii) The following output is produced:
```
    Current date and time: 2024-09-10 22:50:48.701758
    In ten days it will be the date and time: 2024-09-20 22:50:48.701758
```
Thus, in ten days the date/time will be 2024-09-20 at 22:50
