You are not supposed to change the functions, but you need to import one module from the Python standard library that is used in one of the functions. \n\nThe two functions might use Python functionality that you are not yet familiar with, so it is also an excercise in understanding Python code.\n\nThe three tasks are I: Read from files, and II: Write to files, and III Read from file and filter content\nThere are three code blocks at the end of this notebook, where you can write the code.\n\nTask I: Read from files\n------------------------\n1) Write code that reads the two text files located in `/kaggle/input/io-lab-text-files`. In the code block below, there is example code which prints out the names of the files in `/kaggle/input/io-lab-text-files`.  Instead of just printing the file names,  you should open and read the files. Use the syntax `with open(\"file_name.txt\", encoding=\"utf-8\") as my_file:` . \n\n**What Python keywords are you using in your code for opening a file?**\n\nAppend the texts that you have read from the files to the list `text_list`. I.e., the list should contain two strings, one with the text from the file `intro.txt` and one with the text in the file `history.txt`.\n\nTo check that it works, you can, e.g. print the content of `text_list`.\n\n2) Try to understand as much as possible from the `get_nonsense_text_modifications` function. To be able to run it, you must import a module. Add this import, after `import os` below. \n\n**What module do you import?**\n\n**What is the expected type for the parameter to the `get_nonsense_text_modifications` function? \n\n**What does the function return?**\n\n**What type does`\" \".join(modified_text_list)` create?**\n\n3) Run the code for task I.\n\n4) The `get_nonsense_text_modifications` function has two return values.  \n\n**How can you see that it returns two values?** \n**What is the syntax used for storing the results from a function returning multiple values?** (Note that you can also see it as a tuple, and treat it as a tuple.)\n\n5) **The second return value is the total number of upper-case letters in all \n        modified strings. How many are there?**\n        \n6) The first return value is a list containg the modified strings. You need this list for task II.\n\n\nTask II: Write to files\n-------------------\n\n7) Write code that creates a directory where you will store text files. Use the content in the variable `output_dir` for naming the directory. Before creating it, check that a directory with that name  does not already exist. (If it already exists, then don't create it.) Use functionality in [https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html) and [https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html). **What functionality in `os` and `os.path` are you using?**\n\n8) Manually check that the code works, i.e. check that the directory that you aimed to create exists. (If you have not specified any other location, the default is that the directory will be created under `/kaggle/working`, which you find under`Output` to the right.)\n\n9) Take the list of strings that was returned from the first task, i.e. the list stored in `modified_text_list`. For each string in the list, write it to a separate txt-file in the `output_dir` directory. \nNote: The files must have the suffix \".txt\".\n\nAs filenames, you can, for instance, use numbers, so that the first filename is written to \"my_output_dir/0.txt\" and the second to \"my_output_dir/1.txt\". \n\nAgain, use the `with open...` syntax. **`open` is a built-in function. It has one mandatory argument, and many optional arguments. What is the mandatory arugment? To write to a file, you need to use one of the optional arguments. Which? What are the other possible values you can use for this optional argument?**\n\nThe filename that you use as argument to `open` needs to include the directory name as well, i.e. it needs to be \"my_output_dir/0.txt\" and not only \"0.txt\". Create the filename-string which includes the directory name by using `os.path.join()`\n**What does `os.path.join` do?**\n\n10) Manually check that the two files have been created in the directory. ()\n\n11) With the `get_size_of_text_files_in_folders` function you will find out the total size of the text files in `/kaggle/input/io-lab-text-files` and in your newly created directory. \n\nTry to understand what happens in `get_size_of_text_files_in_folders`. **What is the function of glob?**\n\n12) **Record the file size for the modified folders**. Which one is largest?\n\nTask III: Read from file and filter content\n=======================================\n13) Read the content from the file \"sustainability_termlist_2022.txt\", line-by-line, and append all rows that start with *enTE* to the list`list_with_enTE`. Before adding the content of the row, remove the staring \"enTE \" and the newline at the end. You will then have a list of english terms.\n\n14) There are at least two ways for reading from a file object, line by line. You could either use a for loop or a method. \n\n**What is the name of the method?**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\nimport glob\nimport string\n\n#####\n# Two functions to use in the lab\n##### \n\n# NOTE: To be able to run this function, you need to import one module from the\n# Python standard library (it's part of the exercise to see which module)\ndef get_nonsense_text_modifications(text_list):\n    \n    # Example of a doc-string\n    \"\"\"Makes a nonsense-modification of a list of strings, \n    and counts the total number of upper-case letters in all \n    modified strings in the list\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    text_list : list\n        A list of strings\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    list\n        a list of modified strings \n    int\n        the number of upper-case letters in all \n        modified strings\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Example of 'assert'\n    assert isinstance(text_list, list), \"The argument to the function must be a list\"\n    \n    # Example of list comprehension\n    modified_text_list = [\"nonsense-modified-text: \\n\" + string.capwords(txt) for txt in text_list]\n    \n    # Example of how to use 'join'\n    nr_of_upper = 0\n    for ch in \" \".join(modified_text_list):\n        if ch.isupper():\n            nr_of_upper += 1 # Example of augmented assignment\n    \n    # Example of how to return multiple values\n    return modified_text_list, nr_of_upper\n    \n# NOTE: To be able to run this function, you need to import the 'os' module, \ndef get_size_of_text_files_in_folders(folders):\n    \n    # Example of a doc-string\n    \"\"\"Takes a list of folder paths.
