Version control\n===============================\n\nThe main point of this assignment is to try version control. \n\nThis assignment will also form the examination of the version control part of the course. Upon passing this assignment, you will have completed the version control part of the course.\n\nThere is much to learn about version control, and by completing this assignment, you will only have made yourself acquainted with the most basic concepts of it.\n\nIn addition to the main aim of version control, you will also practice some Kaggle, the [Markdown syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics), as well as get a bit used to the notion of Python libraries. \n\nRemember that when editing you Kaggle notebook, the changes are **not** automatically saved.
